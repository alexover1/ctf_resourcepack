# CTF Resourcepack

This resourcepack is intended to be used with the [Capture the Flag datapack](https://github.com/alexover1/ctf) I made for Minecraft.
Most of the artwork comes from other people's resourcepacks, which you can find listed in the [credits](CREDITS.md). I do not claim ownership
nor responsibility for any of these files.
